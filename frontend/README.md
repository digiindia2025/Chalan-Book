This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Packing Details Component

The `PackingDetails` component is responsible for managing packing details, including a table for inputting quantities and shade numbers. It allows users to navigate through input fields using the Tab key, enhancing user experience.

### Keyboard Navigation

Keyboard navigation is implemented using the Tab key. Each input field has an `onKeyDown` event handler that checks for the Tab key and moves focus to the next input field accordingly. The component uses `useRef` to manage focus on input fields.

### Utility Functions

The `utils.ts` file provides a utility function for merging class names using the `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` libraries. However, it does not include any functionality related to keyboard handling.
